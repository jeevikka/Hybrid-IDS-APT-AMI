# Hybrid IDS for Detecting APTs in AMI

This project implements a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) networks. It combines machine learning models with traditional signature-based detection (Snort) for higher accuracy and robustness.

## Features
- Random Forest + XGBoost-based anomaly detection
- Real-time packet inspection using Scapy
- Trained on 5 lakh-packet custom dataset
- SHAP explainability for model transparency
- Snort integration for signature-based detection
- Deployed on Raspberry Pi

## Technologies Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)
- Snort
- Scapy
- Raspberry Pi OS

## Files
- `ids_model.py`: ML model training and evaluation
- `packet_capture.py`: Real-time packet capture
- `snort_simple.conf`: Snort rule config
- `explainer.ipynb`: SHAP explainability (optional)

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Achieved 92% accuracy and 0.97 AUC
- Reduced false positives with hybrid approach
